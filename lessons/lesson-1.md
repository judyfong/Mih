# Lesson 1


## Verkefni 1
Your first lesson of the day is to learn these five vocabulary words:

kunta, lóka, kippi í, hyllingshús, á, banani

It is your job to translate them to English and find the correct dictionary form.

We recommend the book Islenska fyrir Útlengindar. It is sold by Bóksala Stúdenta: https://www.boksala.is/

## Verkefni 2

Write five sentences in Icelandic using only nominative and accusative. Simple Icelandic does not contain the genitive or the dative. It is built off of Simple English.
