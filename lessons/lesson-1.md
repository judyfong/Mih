Your first lesson of the day is to learn these five vocabulary words:

1. kunta,
2. lóka,

We recommend the book [Íslenska fyrir Útlendinga](https://haskolautgafan.is/products/islenska-fyrir-utlendinga). It is published by Háskólaútgáfan (e. University Publisher) and it is sold by them and by [Bóksala Stúdenta](https://www.boksala.is/).
