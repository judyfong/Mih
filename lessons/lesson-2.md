# Lesson 2

## Verkefni 1
Learn the Icelandic alphabet from a to ö.
Here's a link to the Wikipedia article which lists the Icelandic alphabet for English readers: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_orthography)

The Icelandic alphabet differs from the English alphabet in several ways. First, there is no c, w, or z. But they still have a pizza (pitsa, flatbaka) chain called [Pizzan.is](https://www.pizzan.is/). Then they have lots of accented letters which they consider separate letters. These are only on the vowels. Finally, they have two letters that are uniquely Icelandic: þ and ð. These both have th-like sounds.
