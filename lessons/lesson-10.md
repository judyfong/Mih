## Lesson 10

In Iceland, there is a subtle difference between I understand and I agree with you.

Ég skil = I agree and I will comply.

Ég skil þig OR Skilþig = I understand (the words coming out of your mouth).

Now fear being misunderstood every time you open your mouth in Icelandic.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
