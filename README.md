## University-of-Reykjavik, Íslande

Associated names are Tweak25 or BorgarHiminnlínan og SilfurEggið

This is a parody school that legitimately teaches icelandic. It is icelandic intended to annoy people just as the mistaken translation, University of Reykjavík annoys me because people can´t even pay attention to this kind of smá atriði á ensku. I call it simple Icelandic. We focus on slang and curse words. Bad grammar is encouraged.


# Community Standards and Guidelines
First hiring practice. We only hire people who know more than no Icelandic at all, nothing more. Second hiring practice is we only hire people whose names start
