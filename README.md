# University-of-Reykjavik
(Menntaskólinn á Íslandi)
This is a parody school that legitimately teaches icelandic. It is icelandic intended to annoy people. I call it simple Icelandic. We focus on slang and curse words.


# Community Standards and Guidelines
First hiring practice. We only hire people who know more than no Icelandic at all, nothing more. Second hiring practice is we only hire people whose names start 
with an M or E like Em who can´t find a job anywhere else. If your nickname starts with an m or e then you qualify to make a pull request. Otherwise your requests 
are delegated only to the Issues section of this repo. If you github name starts with a p or l then you're also banned from submitting issues or pull requests as well.
